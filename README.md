### INTRO
This is my fist website based on the "priming" psychology effect.
I read it on the book called " Thinking Fast, and slow " by Daniel Kahneman.

### HOW IT WOKRS
You choose one of the theme presented to you and click on the bouton "Prime"
you'll see a fast words sequence of 10 words based on the theme you choose.

By doing this multiples time during the day and for atleast a week,
you'll see a drastic change in your decision making.

### WHY IT WORKS

I created this project after "priming" myself that i should be confident about trying things and pushing them in front of a public.

Here you'll have some proof about several studies on that effect :

-In a seminal study by Bargh et al. (1996), participants primed with words related to the elderly stereotype (e.g., "Florida", "Bingo") walked more slowly when exiting the laboratory compared to those exposed to neutral words.

-Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg (1998) found that participants primed with the stereotype of "professor" answered more questions correctly on a general knowledge test than those primed with "soccer hooligan".

-A study by Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that participants primed with money-related cues exhibited increased sensitivity to outcome feedback in risk-taking tasks, as evidenced by enhanced neural responses (e.g., larger RewP amplitudes) during the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART).

### TLDR
I found  this effect interesting so I created a website around it to help people stop procrastinating
in their life.

Give me your feeback (it worked for you ? features ? etc...) Thank you !
